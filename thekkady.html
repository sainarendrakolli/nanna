The region is nestled in the Western Ghats and offers a diverse range of experiences for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers.</p>

<p>The history of Thekkady is closely intertwined with the establishment of the Periyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. The Periyar region, where Thekkady is located, has a long history of human habitation dating back to ancient times. The area was home to indigenous tribal communities, and evidence suggests that it was a part of the ancient spice trade routes.</p>

    <p>The transformation of Thekkady into a significant wildlife conservation area began in the mid-20th century. The Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1934 by the Maharaja of Travancore, and it was later expanded to form the Periyar Tiger Reserve. The primary aim was to protect the diverse flora and fauna of the Western Ghats, especially elephants and tigers. The British colonial administration also recognized the ecological importance of the region.</p>

 <p>One of the key features of Thekkady is the Periyar Lake, created by the Mullaperiyar Dam across the Periyar River. The lake not only serves as a water source but also enhances the scenic beauty of the area. The Periyar National Park was declared a Tiger Reserve in 1978, emphasizing its importance in the conservation of the endangered Bengal tiger.</p>

    <p>Over the years, Thekkady has evolved into a popular eco-tourism destination. The responsible tourism initiatives in the region aim to strike a balance between conservation and sustainable tourism. Visitors can enjoy boat cruises on the Periyar Lake, guided treks, bamboo rafting, and explore the lush spice plantations surrounding the area.</p>
    
   <p> Thekkady's history is not only marked by conservation efforts but also by its growing significance as a tourist destination that offers a unique blend of wildlife, nature, and cultural experiences in the Western Ghats of Kerala.</p>
