<p>The history of Kovalam dates back to ancient times when it served as a fishing village for the local communities in the region. The name "Kovalam" is derived from the Malayalam words "Kovala" and "Aram," which mean "grove of coconut trees." For many years, Kovalam remained a relatively quiet and unexplored coastal area on the Arabian Sea.</p>

   <p> The transformation of Kovalam into a tourist destination began in the 1960s and 1970s when it gained popularity among Western travelers, particularly hippies, who were drawn to its pristine beaches and tranquil surroundings. The influx of international tourists led to the development of basic infrastructure such as accommodations, restaurants, and other facilities catering to the needs of visitors.</p>
